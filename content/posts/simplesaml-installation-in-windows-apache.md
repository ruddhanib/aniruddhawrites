Say you want to install SimpleSAMLphp in windows Apache/Xampp. Let me tell you what I did so far:

  

 1. I have downloaded latest stable version from
    [https://simplesamlphp.org/download](https://simplesamlphp.org/download)
    and placed the unzipped file in Apache folder, i.e.
    C:\Apache24\simplesamlphp directory contains composer.json. I have
    downloaded dependencies as well. 
    
 2. Now when I am going to setup the vhost as shows in the site 6. Configuring Apache section as

```
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName localhost
        DocumentRoot C:/Apache24/htdocs


<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName service.example.com
        DocumentRoot C:/Apache24/service.example.com

        Alias /simplesaml C:/Apache24/simplesamlphp/www
```

 3. Changed the config file  

Now I faced the problem: I am unable to open the Alias in browser. And running httpd.exe in browser shows error about the example.com does not exist.  

Later I found that I was doing some mistake... I am going to add one vhost, rather in Windows Xampp, there is one file /xampp/apache/conf/extra/httpd-xampp.conf. Need to add one Alias below /phpmyadmin statement:  

```
Alias /simplesaml "C:/xampp/simplesamlphp/www"
<Directory "C:/xampp/simplesamlphp/www">
        AllowOverride AuthConfig
        Require all granted
</Directory>
```
Now restart server and hit [http://localhost/simplesaml/](http://localhost/simplesaml/) and all you go...Enjoy you SAML!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
